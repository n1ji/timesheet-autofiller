# timesheet-autofiller

Install tampermonkey [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

Then click [here](https://github.com/n1ji/timesheet-autofiller/raw/refs/heads/main/Year%20Up%20Timesheet%20Autofill.user.js) to automatically install the script to the extension

When you go to your timesheet, the form should automatically fill itself. The last question will be random each time you reload the page.

Once you install it, you can click on the tampermonkey extension, click dashboard and then click on the script. You should then be able to modify the code to change your working hours and responses.
